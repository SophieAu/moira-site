This is the website for Moira Barrett, built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).


## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run `yarn install`.**

2.  **Run the Development Build.**

    `gatsby develop`

    You can now continue editing and the site will auto-update. It's running on `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Build for Production.**

    _Note: You don't need this to deploy to production. This is only for debugging._ To build a production-like environment, run `gatsby build`. To inspect that page, run `gatsby serve`.

4. **Deploy to Production.**

    To deploy to production, simply commit your changes to master and push to GitHub. A web hook will take care of everything and re-deploy the site automatically.
