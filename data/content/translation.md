Born to a German mother and a US-American father, I grew up speaking both German and English. Studying both in the United States and in Germany for my undergraduate and graduate degrees concentrated in literature, art history and creative writing gave me a firm grasp on both languages at the academic level, particularly for the cultural sector. Since 2019 I have been translating texts for museum and artist publications from German to English and from English to German.
