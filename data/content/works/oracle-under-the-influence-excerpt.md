I was raised to believe that my name is an ancient Greek word for fate.

Last September I worked in Paris for a week before flying down the Adriatic coast to Athens to visit my friend Rodanthí. Her name means rosebud.  
I had visited her once before and always wanted to go back.  
I felt that Athens held something for me to uncover.

Not long after landing I was put in my place by a silver-haired Piscean, who clarified that my name does not mean fate and is not ancient Greek. Not quite.  
Rather, it is a crude transliteration of the still-modern Greek μοίρα, meaning destiny.  
A transliteration is created to make a word legible in a foreign alphabet.

Therefore the correct English transliteration of μοίρα, in which the O is meant to be silent, would be _Mira_.

The ancient root of the word μοίρα means fair portion, lot of the whole, or allotment in life. That makes a Moira a distortion of whatever lot in life the fates would have spun, apportioned, and cut to size to describe a mortal’s time on Earth.  
A destiny compromised, misinterpreted, or deliberately misheard.

Stripped of my imagined status as an insider among the ancients, I bought a bus ticket for a day-trip to Delphi, once the most famed oracle far and wide.

The bus from Athens took me there on the same mountain road traveled by Apollo after he was exiled from his native Mount Olympus. The valley below Delphi was filled to the brim with olive trees, silvery leaves flickering in the wind like little sardines, so the groves looked almost like water from above.

When Apollo first arrived at Delphi, he encountered a primitive oracle made of wax and feathers occupied by the Titaness Phoibe, whom he soon pushed out to found his first temple and establish himself as the source of all fortunes issued there.

Today the most intact parts of the Delphic ruin are not its temples, but its treasuries.  
I passed one on almost every level of what was once a terraced city built into the red-gray slope.

While Phoibe’s favored votive offerings were honey cakes, the sun god’s materialism would manifest itself in the growth and eventual bloating of his oracular site, primarily in the form of tributes hewn from the most precious of metals: gold.

The prehistoric oracle of Phoibe (whose name Apollo _Phoebus_ would also come to adopt as his own) was directly accessible to its inquirers. The exchange of perishable honey-baked offering for plainspoken prophecy took place immediately within the mouth(piece) of the god, the priestess Pythia – piece of cake, and perhaps why _oracle_ refers to prophecy, oracular site, and priestess interchangeably.

This priestess’s visions of the future were provoked by the hallucinogenic fumes of a subterranean river, which flowed under the Temple of Apollo.  
If it didn’t dry up over the summer, that river is flowing even now.  
Last September I washed my hands and face in the fountain at the foot of the Delphic slope, where its water now comes out of a pipe in the mountainside.

After the apollonian takeover, the oracle’s fame grew, and Delphi became increasingly exclusive. Priests were tasked with interpreting and transcribing the Pythia’s utterances, which some say became more cryptic as time went on.  
The relocation of divine correspondence from within the priestess herself onto the page transformed ephemeral spoken oracles into slips of paper small enough to fit inside a fortune cookie, making room for negotiation. Originally intended to streamline the prophetic process, the priests soon became targets of bribery of increasingly decadent proportions.

When I heard this, I couldn’t help but feel for the priests: estranged from the metaphysical source they claimed to serve, they wouldn't be the first to struggle with the difference between a bribe and a gift.

A crucial distinction at ancient Delphi, where an offering was a gesture of submission, first to a question and then its answer, but a bribe was an intervention in the unknown, a rhetorical question designed to muffle the oracle’s murmurings in its mouth.

Kings began coming to Delphi for political advice, and before long their gifts had turned from shows of gratitude to into displays of might and intimidation, preemptive reminders of what Delphi stood to gain from telling a powerful inquirer what he wanted to hear.

The oracle soon became a standard source of pretexts for intrigue and war. Not only treasuries, but monuments and lesser temples popped up along the mountainside to hold the constant influx of goods. What began as a divine outpost founded by a temporarily homeless son of Zeus was gentrifying into a hub for the psychic arts.

The strategy of dumping cash into Delphi to divert the underflow of oracular knowledge always worked at first.  
To bribe a functionary of the divine should be futile, but on Earth there is always the element of time.  
In the window of unreality where the oracle distorted in your favor has not yet been disproven, where the queen you married has not yet revealed herself to be your long lost mother, any empire is possible.

During my visit I heard a tour guide describe Delphi as the biggest open air library on Earth, an ancient city covered in inscriptions.

Miles and miles of μοίραs misinterpreted in stone.

If not intentionally misheard by a priest in person, these destinies could just as easily have been misread, or sounded out in the wrong tones by an archeologist any time over the last 300 years.

On an uninitiated tongue that pronounces silent letters while rendering others mute, intended sounds and meanings of an alphabet recede from its surface, waiting indefinitely to be recognized and spoken aloud by a native or a more competent stranger.

It was only a matter of time before a modern hand took an ancient μοίρα and poured it over a 90s baby’s head in English, making her a Moira.
