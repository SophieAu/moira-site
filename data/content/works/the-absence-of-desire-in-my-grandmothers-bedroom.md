When you wake up in Grandmother’s bed you turn your head to look out of the sliding glass door, through the trees and over the water of Hull Creek. Very early on the second morning between her death and her funeral, I see a group of wild geese floating on the water in the dim light, facing the house. They appear to be paying their respects, and watching over the land in this moment of leaderless stillness.

I feel the glass curving around these days already. As Grandmother lay in the hospital I thought about sleeping in her room and surveying the wealth of materials she was leaving behind. I open the closets before she dies, but I don’t walk in and sit down until afterwards. The carpet continues from the stairs into the two bedrooms, the two bathrooms, and the two walk-in closets. Every corner is cushioned. Shelves and racks are filled with sweaters folded into squares. Less visible but equally organized are folders of paperwork, old letters, a box of expensive liquor hidden from those family members with drinking problems who are still among us, the commissioner’s military medals.

Seems like she never had to come up against any walls after he died.  
I never heard her say “cheap,” just “inexpensive.”  
I never asked if she had any real problems that I didn’t know about.
