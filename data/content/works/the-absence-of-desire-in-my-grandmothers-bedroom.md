_Even to the barbarian with no gods, the guest remains sacred.   
_\[Die Nibelungen\]

But in order to enjoy time away from home or work with less domestic or financial worries, a renter or owner sometimes makes a temporary pact with an unholy guest: the house-sitter or studio sub-letter left up to her host’s devices. Because an absent host is unable to graciously muffle her guest’s thoughts and desires at every turn and an idle mind is the devil’s amusement park, the guest will gradually forget her manners.

A perk of being an absent host is not having to talk to your guests, but regardless of how well guest knows host and whether or not host knows it, the two will become closer when the latter leaves the former to it or it to her, removing any need for the guest’s ceremonial validation of the way the host lives. Unburdened of its function as setting for performances such as _The Perfect Hostess_ or _The Frazzled Hostess_, her world asks for nothing and does not need to be seen.

An absent host's possessions are self-satisfied monads waiting faithfully for the return of their owner’s touch, keeping some secrets covered and speaking plainly of others with no hint of either pride or shame. The good guest’s task is to live among them stealthily and to preserve their untouched look and feel. An absent host trusts an unholy guest to snoop with love, if she must.
