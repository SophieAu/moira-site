I can ask someone to get on top and lie there, heavy  
but nothing proves I am solid  
and _can_ force transformation  
like the ocean roar of anonymity  
when it surrounds  
each birthmark and baby wrinkle  
in memory foam

you can’t _force_ him to quit, Mom once said about his smoking

well wave hits rock and must become spray  
clear radio signal meets wildly gesticulating arm  
and has no choice but to dissolve into static

I can try not to love the space between us and lie there, heavy  
but child raised on distance  
learns to be understood by it  
_und wenn die Wörter bei meinem Antlitz außeinanderfallen, dann gibts auch keine Misverständnisse ;)_

when form disappears  
into the _sssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhut up_ of the wild  
the command that enforces itself  
you can listen, go unheard of  
or enjoy the relief of being apprehended, silenced and immortalized at every level  
fossilized without pain

if grains of sand turned pixels of gray rock are just white noise as hard silence  
then it makes no difference whether you turn to stone or fall to pieces

if fist is stop and slap is go  
hold tight means save  
and  
scatter, splurge  
then stone is the middle and sand is the end  
the beginning, they say, was soft and harmless  
but who remembers
