Coffee, shower, local news  
  
Ritual only conjures you,  
truant.  
Your outline flickers in the morning drizzle and  
stiff or sweet  
It hovers there  
outside my window  
crook of my neck  
sore spot of my swollen daybreak

Your outline ripples on the fire escape  
any minute you’ll waft inside  
seep under my faulty skull and

trickle down my throat  
to pool behind my ribcage.

You’ll ebb and flow there,  
lapping at my backbone  
all day long.
