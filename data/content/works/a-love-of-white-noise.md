I can ask him to get on top and lie there, heavy  
but nothing proves I am solid  
and _can_ force transformation  
like the ocean roar of anonymity  
when it surrounds  
each birthmark and baby wrinkle  
in memory foam

you can’t _force_ him to quit, Mom once said about your smoking

well wave hits rock and must become spray  
clear radio signal meets wildly gesticulating arm  
and has no choice but to dissolve into static

I can try not to love the space between us and lie there, heavy  
but child raised on distance  
learns to be understood by it  
_und wenn die Wörter bei meinem Antlitz außeinanderfallen, dann gibts auch keine Misverständnisse ;)_
