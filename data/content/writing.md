  info: 'a love of white noise  not to be consumed, but to be surrounded  I can ask
    you to just lie on top and be heavy, but in the end  nothing holds me like the
    ocean roar of anonymity where there is no projection upon, just a surrounding
    of   no room for misunderstanding, just perfect dispersion around a solid object:  the
    foam when a wave hits a rock the static when your raised arm interferes with the
    radio signal  a moving mold, never to be outgrown.  When the operator puts me
    on hold, when the phone call gets distorted. When the boundary blurs and dilates
    to hold me  I go home.  Maybe I love the space between us too much to open all
    the way up except for special occasion penetration   lately I feel it snuggling
    up again, pink cottony insulation my first friend, how could I discard it?   I
    was raised on distance so I learned to be nourished by it,   and since the meaning
    will be changed by the time your words reach me anyway I may as well listen to
    the sound of your voice in another language.'
